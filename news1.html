    <h2>MG5</h2>

         Leading the charge on the electric estate front was the MG 5, the first such car available on these shores and still a bestseller for the firm.

         It’s been here so long that MG treated the model to a mid-life facelift in 2022, and much improved it was too: where its predecessor was a rather bland looking thing, the current 5 is a completely different prospect entirely, with its sharp face, LED lights front and rear and suave cabin. There’s now also vehicle to load capability, enabling you to power anything from a coolbox to a coffee machine.
         
         Prices start at £30,995 for the base spec SE trim, and the top spec Trophy trim costs £33,495, with every model also getting a seven-year warranty. If you can avoid the badge snobbery, there’s much to like.

    <h2>Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo</h2>

            “The Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo is the most complete fast estate available today,” we concluded in our full review – and that pretty much sums up all you need to know.

            Compared to the regular Taycan, it sits a little higher, there’s more rear headroom, and you get a slightly bigger boot. There’s more to come too, because in early 2024 Porsche announced a significant update to its electric flagship, with improved power, range and charging times. Heck, the Turbo S version will now do 0-62mph in just 2.5 seconds. Can anything stop it?

        <h2>Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo</h2>

                Got your eye on a Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo, but want slightly less of the Audi Allroad treatment? The Taycan Sport Turismo, which sees the ride height slightly lowered and the plastic body cladding prised off, could be your answer.

                Post facelift you now get an 89kWh battery in the entry-level Sport Turismo, while a 402bhp electric motor drives the rear wheels for a 0-62mph time of 4.8 seconds and a range of 352 miles on a single charge. There's 270kW DC rapid charging too. Want more speed? The Turbo S now has a bonkers 939bhp and does 0-62mph in 2.4 seconds, but the proper driver's Sport Turismo may be the mid-range GTS.

            <h2>Peugeot e-308 SW</h2>

                    Peugeot’s design team are on a roll of late, and the third generation 308 and 308 SW are no exception. Originally available with petrol and diesel engines only, Peugeot has since rolled out hybrid and fully electric powertrains to both the hatchback and estate. Result.

                    The e-308 SW (short for Sports Wagon, FYI) gets a 154bhp electric motor mated to a 54kWh battery for up 254 miles of range (and a best-in-class efficiency of 4.93 miles per kW, it claims), with 100kW fast charging allowing for a 20-80 per cent top-up in 25 minutes, if you can find a plug capable of those speeds.
                    
                    Inside you get Peugeot’s smart looking i-Cockpit, while boot capacity is 548 litres with the rear seats up, and 1,574 litres up to the roof with the rear seats down. 
                    
                    "Probably the best all-rounder you can currently buy at the affordable end of the market," was the verdict in our review.

                <h2>Vauxhall Astra Electric Sports Tourer</h2>

                        We’re big fans of the Vauxhall Astra Electric – great looks, decent to drive and low running costs – so a longer, more spacious, bigger booted variant was always going to appeal to our better nature too.

                  And lo, meet the Vauxhall Astra Electric Sports Tourer. Doesn’t roll off the tongue quite so easily, does it? Still, it shares the same 154bhp electric motor, 54kWh battery, 254ish-mile range as the Peugeot e-308 SW – yep, plenty of Stellantis cross platform sharing going on here – but gets a slightly more mature suit.

               It gets a slightly smaller boot compared to the Peugeot though, with 516 litres seats up and 1,553 seats down. Is a little bit plain too.

                    <h2>Audi A6 e-tron Avant
                    </h2>

                            When the A6 e-tron concept broke cover back in April 2021, we were suitably impressed but also secretly crossing our fingers and toes hoping for an Avant version. Estates are both better looking and far more practical than saloons, of course.

                      A year later Audi revealed the A6 Avant e-tron concept - suitably futuristic without being OTT. Thankfully the production car looks remarkably similar to that original design. It's based on the new PPE platform that's shared with Porsche and you can even have an S6 Avant with 543bhp.

                        <h2>BMW i5 Touring</h2>

                                At the BMW Group’s annual conference in March 2023, boss Oliver Zipse confirmed what we’ve known about estate cars for years. “The BMW 5 Series Touring is very popular,” he said. “From spring 2024 it will also come in an all-electric version, giving us a truly unique selling point in this segment.”

                                And he was true to his word. The BMW i5 Touring is available in two iterations, the entry-level i5 eDrive40 (rear-wheel drive, 335bhp, 295lb ft) which offers up to 348 miles of range from its 81kWh battery pack, and the range-topping i5 M60 (all-wheel drive, 593bhp, 586lb ft), capable of the 0-62mph sprint in 3.9secs, but a slightly reduced 314 miles range from its identical sized battery.
                                
                                BMW tells us all models get the same 570 / 1,700 litre (seats up / down) boot. Prices start from £69,945.

                                    Back in 2019, Volkswagen previewed its ID.Space Vizzion concept – a stylish, futuristic, fantastic looking fully electric estate – at the Los Angeles Motor Show – before it all went very quiet. A little too quiet for our liking.

                                    Then, in early 2023, VW revealed its ID.7 saloon (which you can read about by clicking these blue words), before confirming that an estate (Tourer) version would follow. A year later it finally arrived – hurrah! – and now you can have it in all-wheel drive GTX form with 335bhp and a 0-62mph time of 5.5 seconds.

                                        If there’s one thing better than an S6 e-tron, it’s an RS6 e-tron. While details are few and far between at time of writing, that hasn’t stopped us dreaming.

We do at least have some clues on the design, with Audi design boss Marc Lichte telling TG the RS6 will have a wider track and bigger wheels to set it apart from the A6 e-tron. Nothing out of the ordinary there – the current combustion-engined RS6 is the angriest looking to date.

Expect the upcoming electric RS6 to smash the S6 e-tron’s 0-62mph time of 3.9 seconds. Supercar performance in a practical package. Nice.
